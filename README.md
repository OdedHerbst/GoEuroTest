# GoEuroTest
This is a test application that receives a location as an input and queries go euro server. The result is formatted to csv and written to file
Assumptions :
1) If no data was retreived for a certain location, no data is written
2) Files are NEVER overwritten just indexed
3) If a data field is null, "null" will be written in the csv file

Enjoy ;)
